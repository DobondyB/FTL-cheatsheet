    <h1>FTL Cheatsheet</h1>
    <p>This page summarizes all the events in <a href="https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html">FTL Advanced Edition</a>.
       I created it because I got tired of wading through slow wiki pages and unreadable XML data files,
       when I am trying to remember what a particular event does.
       Use Ctrl-F to find the event your are looking for, and have fun!
    </p><p>Notes: You can use Ctrl-S to save a local copy of this page.
       Some events in the list may be test or demo events, which cannot be encountered via normal gameplay.
       It you have a suggestion, you can send feedback <a href="https://github.com/hugomg/ftl-cheatsheet/issues">here</a>.
